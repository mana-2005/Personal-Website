            <h3>Project 1 : Online Voting System</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement : </strong><br>
            Traditional voting systems face challenges such as inefficiency, security risks, and logistical issues. Voters often experience long queues, errors, and a lack of transparency, leading to disenfranchisement and fraud. There is a growing need for a secure, accessible, and user-friendly online voting platform that ensures transparency, privacy, and integrity in the voting process.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works : </strong><br>
                Registration: Users sign up with their details (email, password).<br>
                Login: Voters log in securely.<br>
                Vote: They select their choice (like a candidate) on the webpage.<br>
                Submit: The vote is sent and saved securely.<br>
                Confirmation: Voters get a message confirming their vote.<br>
                Results: After voting ends, results are counted and shown.<br>

            <h3>Project 2 : Air Quality Predictor</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem Statement : </strong><br>
                Air pollution is a severe environmental and health issue affecting millions of people worldwide, particularly in urban areas. Existing air quality monitoring systems often provide incomplete, outdated, or inaccessible data, hindering informed decision-making and effective mitigation strategies.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How it works : </strong><br>
             Data Collection: We gather air quality data from various sensors and sources<br>
             Prediction Model: We use advanced algorithms to predict future air pollution levels.<br>
             User Interface: Information is presented in a simple, easy-to-understand form.<br>
